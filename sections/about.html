        <p class="about-description">
            I am a social individual, but I don't engage much in
            social media where memories are often buried within
            posts. My interests range from the delightful fragrance
            of flowers🌻 to the refreshing scent of a clover-filled
            breeze. As someone immersed in the field of computer
            science🧑‍💻, I am particularly passionate about
            tackling new problems that can have a meaningful
            societal impact, whether they are easily solvable or
            not. This journey not only helps me refine my approach
            and skills but also contributes to my continuous
            learning. I draw significant inspiration from Steve Jobs
            as a person and consider "Sapiens" a highly influential
            book.
